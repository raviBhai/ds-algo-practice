* A **graph** consists of **N nodes** (or vertices) and **M edges**.

* A **Spanning Tree** is a subgraph that:

  * Includes **all N nodes** of the original graph.
  * Has exactly **N - 1 edges**.
  * Is **connected** (i.e., there is a path between every pair of nodes).
  * Contains **no cycles**.

* A single graph can have **multiple spanning trees**.

* In a **weighted graph**, each edge has an associated **weight** or cost.

* To find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** in a weighted graph:

  * Generate all possible spanning trees.
  * Calculate the total weight (sum of edge weights) for each.
  * The spanning tree with the **smallest total weight** is the **Minimum Spanning Tree**.

### ❓ How to Find MST in an **Unweighted Graph**

In an **unweighted graph**, all edges are considered to have **equal weight**, typically weight = 1. So, any spanning tree will automatically have the **minimum possible total weight**, since all edges cost the same.
